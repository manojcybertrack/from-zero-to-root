Basic Netwworking:
Complete Networking Summary for Pentesting (As Learned by Manoj)


---

1. Introduction to Networking:

Definition of Networking

Importance of Networking in Cybersecurity and Pentesting


2. Fundamental Concepts:

What is an IP Address?

Static vs Dynamic IP

Public vs Private IP


MAC Address

DNS (Domain Name System)

Ports and Protocols

Common Ports: 80, 443, 21, 22, 25, 53, etc.


TCP/IP Model vs OSI Model

Layers and Responsibilities



3. IP Addressing & Subnetting:

IPv4 and IPv6

Classes of IP Addresses (A, B, C)

Subnet Mask

CIDR Notation

Default Gateway Concept

How routing decisions are made


4. Core Networking Devices:

Hub (Broadcasts to all ports)

Switch (Multicast, Intelligent forwarding)

Router (Chooses best path, encrypts, forwards packet)

Bridge (Connects two networks)

Repeater (Amplifies signal)

Modem (Modulates/Demodulates signals)

Gateway (Protocol Translator)

Access Point

Firewall (Monitors incoming/outgoing traffic, enforces rules)

Proxy Server (Acts on behalf of client, hides identity)


5. Address Allocation & Management:

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

Works in Routers, ISP Towers, assigns IP automatically


NAT (Network Address Translation)


6. Packet Journey Explanation:

Packet as a "traveller"

Router as a "bus" and "path decision maker"

Path optimization and traffic load awareness

What happens if packet is dropped?

TCP handles retransmission

ICMP for diagnostics (ping, traceroute)



7. Special Protocols & Concepts:

ICMP (for network diagnostics)

VPN (Virtual Private Network)

Encrypts traffic, hides identity

Tunnel between client and destination


ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

DNS Resolution Process

Proxy Server working with cache, anonymity


8. Security & Real-Life Mapping:

How all these devices/protocols are relevant in Pentesting

Real life examples (Phone connecting to IP via DHCP, Router forwarding, Firewall blocking unauthorized requests, etc.)


9. Revisions and Mastery:

3x Revisions completed

Learned all networking concepts without a laptop

Priority given to practical understanding

Understood implementation importance, will apply later
